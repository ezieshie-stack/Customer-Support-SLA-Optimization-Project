# Customer Support SLA Optimization — $30K Monthly Savings via Predictive Escalation

## Executive Summary
This project identifies structural SLA failures in customer support operations and deploys a predictive decision system (“The Sniper”) that reduces breach-related financial loss by **68%** under realistic capacity constraints. Using statistical validation, machine learning, and cost-based simulation, the solution converts analytics into an operational command center suitable for executive deployment.

## The Business Problem
Support operations currently manage tickets using detailed priority queues but lack real-time visibility into breach risk.
*   **Critical SLA breaches are expensive**, driving $213k in historical operational waste.
*   **Manual escalation is reactive**, often catching issues only after they have failed.
*   **Leadership lacks a lever** to balance intervention capacity against financial risk.

## The Solution
This operational intelligence suite moves the organization from "Firefighting" to "Sniper-Like Precision":

*   **Diagnosis (Phase 2B)**: Statistical proofs (Cramer's V) confirmed that "Critical" priority tickets fail structurally after 8 hours, debunking the myth that specific channel teams were to blame.
*   **Prediction (Phase 2C)**: A cost-optimized Random Forest model flags incoming tickets with **89% ROC-AUC** accuracy, trained specifically to minimize financial loss rather than just prediction error.
*   **Simulation (Phase 3B)**: A capacity-aware simulation proved that reviewing just the **Top 50** riskiest tickets/day yields 68% of the total possible benefit, optimizing for team workload.
*   **Product (Phase 4B)**: An interactive **SLA Risk Command Center** (Streamlit) allows managers to visualize live risks and adjust escalation capacity dynamically.

## Key Results
| Metric | Baseline (No AI) | With "The Sniper" | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Financial Loss** | $44,200 (Test Set) | $14,200 | **$30,000 Saved** (2 Days) |
| **ROI** | — | 150x | **High Return** on Agent Time |
| **Breach Risk** | High | Low | **68% Reduction** |
| **Operational Impact** | Reactive | Proactive | **Fixed 50 Tickets/Day** Load |

**Projected Annual Impact:** ~$450,000 to ~$700,000 in prevented SLA penalties and churn risk.

## Skills Demonstrated
*   **Operational Analytics**: Translating "breach rates" into "financial exposure".
*   **Predictive Modeling**: Cost-sensitive Machine Learning (Random Forest) optimizing for business value ($), not just accuracy.
*   **Simulation & Optimization**: Designing capacity-constrained strategies (The Nuke vs The Sniper) for real-world deployment.
*   **Executive Science**: Packaging complex stats into a board-ready narrative and interaction model.
